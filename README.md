# ISSTracker
A Mechatronics project to point at the ISS

------------------------------------------

This was my final project for ME430 Mechatronics using a PIC18F4520 microcontroller. The goal was to build a device that can point to the ISS given that the device starts facing north. The calculated tracking data aligns very well with the tracker at http://www.n2yo.com/?s=25544 .

Since I used the python library pyephem, it is incredibly easy to add other earth-orbiting objects and other celestial bodies to track. We have 4 buttons on our device to switch between tracking the ISS, the Sun, the moon, and reset to initial orientation.
